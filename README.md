# Heroes Of Pymoli Data Analysis
 
## Background
After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

### Observable Trends 
- Of the 1163 active players, the vast majority are male (84%). There also exists, a smaller, but notable proportion of female players (14%).
- Our peak age demographic falls between 20-24 (44.79%) with secondary groups falling between 15-19 (18.58%) and 25-29 (13.37%).
- The age group that spends the most money is the 20-24 with $1,114.06 dollars as total purchase value and an average purchase of $4.32. In contrast, the demographic group that has the highest average purchase is the 35-39 with $4.76 and a total purchase value of $147.67.

The final report includes each of the following:

## Conclusion:
In this project, the information is used to express data visually and represent it to an audience in a clear format. I would like to focus on a couple of trends that caught my attention:
- Take a look at "purchasing analisys by age", the age group of 20-24 has been observed as a group which is interested in buying games the most.
- If we take a closer look at "purchasing analysis by gender", we'll notice that men were intersted in purchasing the game rather than women; interesting fact, that those women who made a dicision to commit to purchase the game, chose more expensive version than men did. 
- Also, I'd like to compare "most popular items" vs "most profitable", where /Oathbreaker, Last Hope of thye Breaking Storm/  was one of the most profitable as well as popular game at that time. While /Fierly Glass/ was second popular game, while on profitability list it was #3. 
- Lastly, on the list of popularity /Nirvana/ was on the fourth position, while it was second the most profitable game to be sold.

It is obvious that a current analysis gives us not just better understanding of data given to us, but also let us look at the game market from a different prospective.
